# If we need to calculate the area of SQUARE in py then we need to know the length of one side of the square.

# Then
# Area = length*length

# def square_area(side_length):
#    area = side_length * side_length
#    return area

# Example usage:
# side_length = 5
# print("Area of the square with side length", side_length, "is:", square_area(side_length))
